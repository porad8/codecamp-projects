                    Maathai stood up courageously against the former oppressive regime in Kenya. Her unique forms of action have contributed to drawing attention to political oppressionâ€”nationally and internationally. She has served as inspiration for many in the fight for democratic rights and has especially encouraged women to better their situation.
